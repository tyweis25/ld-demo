# LaunchDarkly Factory Settings Skill

An Agent Skill for configuring Factory (GitHub App auto-flagging and auto-releasing) through the LaunchDarkly MCP, and for diagnosing why a PR was not classified.

## Overview

This skill teaches agents how to:

- Diagnose "why didn't Factory classify my PR?" (account gate → mapped repo → repo override) before changing anything
- Read account-wide Factory defaults
- Confirm every write (account, map, repo override, unmap) before calling MCP
- List GitHub App install repos as `owner/name`

## Installation (Local)

- **Generic**: copy `skills/factory/launchdarkly-factory-settings/` into your client's skills path

## Prerequisites

The remotely hosted LaunchDarkly MCP server must expose the Factory settings tools (`get-factory-settings`, `list-factory-github-repos`, `update-factory-repo-settings`, and siblings). The GitHub App must already be installed; this skill does not install it.

Factory settings are in alpha. The endpoints behind these tools are gated by the `enable-factory-settings` flag, so accounts outside the alpha get 404s.

## Usage

```
Why didn't Factory classify my pull request?
```

```
Turn on auto-flagging and map launchdarkly/gonfalon to project default
```

```
Which GitHub repos are mapped for Factory, and which can I map?
```
