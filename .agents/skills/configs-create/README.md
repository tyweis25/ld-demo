# LaunchDarkly Config Create Skill

An Agent Skill for creating configs in LaunchDarkly. Guides choosing agent vs completion mode, creating the config and variations, and verifying the result.

## Overview

This skill teaches agents how to:
- Understand the use case and choose agent vs completion mode
- Create configs using MCP tools (`setup-ai-config` for one-step, or `create-ai-config` + `create-ai-config-variation` for more control)
- Set up model configuration with the correct `modelConfigKey` format
- Verify creation via the tool response or `get-ai-config`
